\subsection{Terminology}

Some of the following terminology has been adapted from the problem statement.

\begin{itemize}
\item A \textbf{mile-marker} is a roadside marker that measures distance along the road from a fixed point.
\item A \textbf{road segment} is any portion of road between two consecutive mile-markers.
\item The \textbf{average daily traffic (ADT)} is the average number of cars per day driving on the road.
\item The \textbf{increasing direction} is Northbound for N-S roads and Eastbound for E-W roads.  The \textbf{decreasing direction} is the opposite of the increasing direction.
\end{itemize}
