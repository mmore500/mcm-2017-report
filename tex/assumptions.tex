\section{Overall Assumptions} \label{sec:assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
\item We assume that the density of traffic on a road segment is constant and evenly spread across all available lanes. We also neglect the inefficiencies in traffic flow introduced by lane-changing.
\item We assume that traffic is divided evenly between increasing and decreasing directions on roadways.
\item We assume that ``all roads are created equal." That is, interstates, highways, state routes, etc. are not treated differently.
\item Furthermore, we assume that all roads are flat and straight, not changing in altitude or direction.
\item Our model treats only major highways in the Puget Sound area: I-5, I-90, I-405, and SR 520.
\item Our model neglects intersections between major highways, treating each as an independent stretch of road.
\item We assume that highway conditions on the boundaries of the Puget Sound region are wide-open.
\item We assume self-driven cars will randomly slow down with half the probability that a human would.
\item We assume that a near-equilibrium traffic distribution is reached at both peak and normal traffic loads.
